"I found myself bogged down in so many doubts and errors, that it seemed to me that having set out to become learned, I had derived no benefit from my studies, other than that of progressively revealing to myself how ignorant I was."

➥ Excerpt from René Descartes’ *Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One's Reason and of Seeking Truth in the Sciences*

<br><br>

I've been thinking a lot about the fact that my very existence is an improbability given the natural disorder of the system we are able to *discern*. By that I mean there is an alternate course of events that, by virtue of seemingly *imperceptible* change, would alter the sequence of events in such a manner that life on the planet we call earth never even existed. Say for instance, the modelled *Proto-Earth* and *Theia* collision resulted in the Earth’s orbit to be outside the *Goldilocks Zone* resulting in a medium uninhabitable by carbon-based life. Otherwise known as the *Butterfly Effect*. I will not even speak on the peculiarities around particle physics and how they might feed into this argument. It is reported by *Discovery* that if the Earth were restarted, the likelihood of life occurring is *one in three*. A bit like rolling a three-sided die. Nevertheless, I find the *entropy* does keep me grounded in front of this tantalizing mystery I call *reality*.
